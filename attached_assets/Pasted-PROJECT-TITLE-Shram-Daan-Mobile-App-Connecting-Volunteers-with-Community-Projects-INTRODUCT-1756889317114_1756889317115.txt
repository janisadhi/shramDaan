PROJECT TITLE

“Shram Daan: Mobile App Connecting Volunteers with Community Projects”

INTRODUCTION
Shram Daan is a community-focused mobile app that connects volunteers with local social and
environmental initiatives. It facilitates easy discovery, coordination, and participation in voluntary
labor projects such as cleanups, tree planting, school painting, temple restoration, and more. By
streamlining communication, scheduling, and volunteer recognition, Shram Daan empowers
communities to unite, contribute meaningfully, and promote self-reliance through collective action

Scope and Objectives:
The aim of this project is to develop a mobile application that enables individuals to participate in and
organize community service projects (Shram Daan). The app will foster self-reliance and civic unity by
helping volunteers find, join, and manage local development efforts.
Objectives:
• Allow users to post and discover nearby volunteer-based social projects.
• Provide tools for project scheduling, reminders, and coordination.
• Promote community involvement through recognition and rewards.
• Encourage participation via simple, user-friendly mobile interface.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Despite the willingness of many individuals to contribute time and effort for public good, there is
no streamlined system to connect community members and organize voluntary labor efforts. This

gap results in underutilized manpower, delayed public works, and missed opportunities for self-
driven development.

Many communities in both rural and urban areas lack basic infrastructure not due to a lack of
funding, but because of the absence of effective coordination and communication tools that can
bring willing volunteers together efficiently.
While social media platforms are often used to call for volunteers, these posts are frequently missed
in users’ feeds or discovered after the event has ended, limiting participation. Additionally, people
interested in volunteering may not find any suitable events during their free time, and often come
across opportunities only when they are already occupied.

Existing event listing apps like Meetup or similar platforms are overloaded with unrelated events,
making it difficult for users to discover relevant volunteer opportunities. This highlights the need
for a dedicated, domain-specific platform that focuses solely on community service and voluntary
labor projects.

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
To address the lack of coordination and visibility in community volunteering efforts, we propose
developing a dedicated mobile application called Shram Daan (श्रमदान). This platform will serve
as a centralized, community-focused hub for organizing, discovering, and participating in
voluntary labor (Shram Daan) projects.
Key Features of the Solution:
• Location-Based Project Discovery: Volunteers can easily find nearby community projects
based on real-time location.
• Event Scheduling and Reminders: Users can view event dates, set reminders, and sync
activities with their calendar.
• Essential Tools List & Benefits Info: Each project will list required tools and
complimentary support (e.g., water/snacks).
• In-App Chat & Notifications: Organizers and participants can communicate seamlessly
and receive timely updates.
• RSVP and Participation Tracking: Volunteers can confirm attendance and get recognized
for their contributions.
• Leaderboards & Rewards: High-performing contributors receive badges, certificates, or
digital tokens.
• Social Media Integration: Users can share projects or their participation to boost
community awareness and involvement.
Technologies to Be Used:
• Frontend: React native (for cross-platform mobile development)
• Backend: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Cloud Messaging)
• APIs: Open street API for geolocation features
• Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (push alerts and reminders)

What Makes This Solution Unique:
• Unlike general-purpose platforms like Meetup, Shram Daan is laser-focused on community
volunteering, cutting through irrelevant content.
• It bridges the gap between intent and action by notifying users when events match their
availability and location.
• It creates a culture of contribution by offering recognition, visibility,
